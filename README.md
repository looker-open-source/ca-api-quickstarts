# Readme

This repository contains notebooks, code samples, sample apps and other resource that demonstrate how to use, develop and manage the DataQnA API on Google Cloud.

# Overview

The DataQnA API (to be renamed) is "chat-with-your-data" API that enables developers to build conversational analytics capabilities into their applications, letting you leverage the power of Google's Al to bring insights to users where they work, rather than bringing users to a new BI tool.
